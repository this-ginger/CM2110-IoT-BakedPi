Element 2 Coursework for CM2110 Internet of Things <br>
<br>
Team name : Baked Pi <br>
Group members : Douglas Hill, Diana Ventura, Samuel Egger, Sarah Stratton <br>
<br>
Project : In-home care support system. <br>
<br>
Use : To support the vulnerable and elderly by unintrusively and intelligently monitoring<br>
and / or contacting loved ones / support teams in the event of an emergency. Part of our<br>
system is also to create a comfortable environment for our users with our comprehensive<br>
climate control system.<br>
The use of this would be as an alternative to a community alarm system <br>
which can be unreliable and may not provide fast enough support in the vital moments<br>
of an emergency situation. <br>
<br>
Hardware : Our project requires several nodes; a wearable smart device, our climate<br>
control 'master' node, NFC sticker tags, one (or more) IP cameras... (insert more)
